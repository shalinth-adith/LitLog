Ideas for Testing
Unit Tests:
  Input validation for AddBookView
  Rating bounds (0â€¦5)
  Book sorting logic
UI Tests:
  Splash â†’ Home navigation
  Add book â†’ check if visible
  Swipe to delete â†’ item disappears
SwiftData Tests:
  In-memory container insert & fetch
  ModelContext delete confirmation

Future Polish Ideas
  Empty state view when no books are added
  Search books by title or author
  Share book review via ShareSheet
  Undo for delete
  Star filter or "Top Rated" view
  iCloud sync
  JSON import/export
